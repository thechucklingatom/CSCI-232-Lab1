Lab1 (Due Feb 10)
Write a program for Huffman Coding.
You might need to use the priority queue and tree data structures given in this repo.
Your program should do the following:

1.) Accept a text message (Could be multiple lines of text)
2.) Create a Huffman tree for this message
3.) Create a code table
4.) Encode the message into binary
5.) Decode the message from binary back to text.

If the nessage is short, the program should be able to display the Huffman tree after creating it.
You can assume there are only letters, space, carriage returns and/or line feeds inthe message.
You can use String variables to store the binary numbers as arrangements of the characters 1 and 0.
Don't worry about doing actual bit manipulation unless you really want to.
A sample output of the program is availalbe in this repo.
